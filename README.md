# paprika-3-mcp

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that exposes your **Paprika 3** recipes as LLM-readable resources — and lets an LLM like Claude create, update, list, and look up recipes (including nutritional info) in your Paprika app. Handy for meal planning and building grocery lists straight from your saved recipes.

### 🖼️ Example: Claude using the Paprika MCP server

## 🤖 Setting up Claude

If you haven't setup MCP before, [first read more about how to install Claude Desktop client & configure an MCP server.](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

To add `paprika-3-mcp` to Claude, all you need to do is create another entry in the `mcpServers` section of your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paprika-3": {
      "command": "paprika-3-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--username",
        "<your paprika 3 username (usually email)>",
        "--password",
        "<your paprika 3 password>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude and you should see the MCP server tools after clicking on the hammerhead icon:

#### 🗂 Miscellaneous

##### 📄 Where can I see the server logs?

The MCP server writes structured logs using Go’s `slog` with rotation via `lumberjack`. Log files are automatically created based on your operating system:

| Operating System | Log File Path                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| macOS            | `~/Library/Logs/paprika-3-mcp/server.log` |
| Linux            | `/var/log/paprika-3-mcp/server.log`       |
| Windows          | `%APPDATA%\paprika-3-mcp\server.log`      |
| Other / Unknown  | `/tmp/paprika-3-mcp/server.log`           |

> 💡 Logs are rotated automatically at 100MB, with only 5 backup files kept. Logs are also wiped after 10 days.
